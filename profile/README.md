# ABJ-d: Game-Based Learning Design
**Course Code:** ABJ-d | **Credits:** 4 | **Professor:** [Jean Pierre Charalambos](https://jpcharalambosh.co/)

## Course Description
This course provides a comprehensive framework for designing, implementing, and evaluating Game-Based Learning (GBL) and gamified educational experiences. Grounded in educational theory and agile development practices, students will progress from problem analysis to a functional, evaluated prototype. The methodology is inspired by Design-Based Research (DBR) and empirical software development, ensuring a rigorous, iterative, and practical approach.

## Course Rubric & Final Grade Composition
The final grade is cumulative and based on the successful completion of four staged deliverables, each corresponding to a phase of the GBL design cycle.

| Stage | Deliverable | Weight | Core Focus & Evaluation Criteria |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1. Problem & Context** | **Research & Analysis Dossier** | 25% | **Context & Problem Definition:** Clarity of the practical educational problem and research gap. Depth of literature review on GBL/edtech in the chosen domain. Quality of foundational theory synthesis. |
| **2. Design** | **GBL Design Document** | 25% | **Design Rigor:** Application of DBR principles. Coherence of learning objectives, mechanics, dynamics, and aesthetics (MDA). Alignment between pedagogical goals and game design. |
| **3. Implementation** | **Functional Prototype** | 25% | **Agile Execution:** Working prototype (digital, analog, or hybrid). Evidence of iterative development. Code/design quality, usability, and adherence to core design. |
| **4. Evaluation** | **Evaluation Report & Reflection** | 25% | **Assessment & Meta-Learning:** Design and application of mixed-methods evaluation (engagement, learning outcomes). Critical analysis of results. Depth of co-evaluation and self-evaluation insights. |

**Passing Note:** A minimum grade of **3.0/5.0** is required to pass the course. The final grade is the weighted sum of the four stage deliverables.

## The Four-Stage Design Cycle
The course follows a structured, iterative cycle from problem identification to evaluation.

### Stage 1: Problem & Context
*   **Goal:** Establish a solid scholarly and practical foundation.
*   **Activities:** Literature review on GBL and specific domain; identification of a clear educational challenge; formulation of a research question; analysis of target audience and context.
*   **Theoretical Grounding:** Recent systematic reviews in game-based learning and educational technology.
*   **Outcome:** A dossier justifying the "why" behind the project.

### Stage 2: Design
*   **Goal:** Translate the problem into a coherent GBL design.
*   **Activities:** Defining learning objectives; applying the MDA framework (Mechanics, Dynamics, Aesthetics); creating design artifacts (storyboards, wireframes, rule sets); planning for engagement and assessment.
*   **Methodological Core:** Grounded in **Design-Based Research (DBR)** principles (Tinoca et al., 2022).
*   **Outcome:** A detailed, actionable GBL Design Document.

### Stage 3: Implementation
*   **Goal:** Build a functional, testable prototype.
*   **Activities:** Agile development sprints; creation of digital (e.g., Unity, web) or analog (board game) prototypes; playtesting for core functionality; iterative refinement.
*   **Methodological Core:** Informed by empirical practices from **Agile Software Development**.
*   **Outcome:** A working prototype (minimum viable product) ready for evaluation.

### Stage 4: Evaluation
*   **Goal:** Assess the prototype's effectiveness and derive insights for future iterations.
*   **Activities:** Designing and conducting evaluation sessions (playtests, surveys, interviews); analyzing qualitative and quantitative data on engagement and learning; performing co-evaluation (peer feedback) and self-evaluation.
*   **Key Focus:** **Gamification** of assessment, **co-evaluation**, and **auto-evaluation**.
*   **Outcome:** A comprehensive report with findings, critical reflection, and a proposed iteration plan.

## Core References & Methodology
The course structure is explicitly built upon the following foundational reviews:
1.  **For Stages 1 & 2:** The systematic literature review on *Design-Based Research in the Educational Field* (Tinoca et al., 2022) provides the methodological backbone for the design cycle.
2.  **For Stage 3:** The systematic review on *Empirical Studies of Agile Software Development* informs the iterative, practical implementation phase.
3.  **For Stage 4:** The focus on **gamification, co-evaluation, and auto-evaluation** aligns with contemporary learner-centered assessment paradigms in GBL.

## Tools & Philosophy
*   **Open-Source First:** Priority is given to open-source tools for design, development, and analysis (e.g., Godot, GIMP, Inkscape, R, Python).
*   **Iterative & Reflective:** The DBR approach mandates cycles of design, implementation, testing, and reflection.
*   **Practice-Oriented:** Learning is demonstrated through the creation and critique of tangible artifacts at each stage.

## 8. Research opprotunities

### GBL Sustainability  

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> **Research Question**: How can game jams for sustainable game-based learning—rooted in self-maintainability, dynamic role transitions, and low-carbon adaptability—enhance [computational thinking skills](https://jpcharalambosh.co/p5.quadrille/12) [^4] while ensuring long-term scalability across diverse educational contexts?

The sustainability framework consists of three key pillars:  

1. **Community-Driven Growth** *(Social Sustainability)*  
   - Promotes role transitions from learner to developer and mentor.  
   - Engages contributors through game jams, workshops, and conferences.  
   - Builds a self-sustaining network, minimizing reliance on external funding.  
2. **Collaborative & Active Learning** *(Economic Sustainability)*  
   - Develops versatile game-based learning tools applicable across disciplines.  
   - Integrates board games and digital tools into formal and informal education settings.  
   - Fosters interdisciplinary collaborations to refine and enhance learning methodologies.  
3. **Long-Term Impact** *(Environmental Sustainability)*  
   - Ensures the continuous refinement of *p5.quadrille.js* through iterative feedback loops.  
   - Strengthens institutional adoption of game-based learning frameworks.  
   - Incorporates low-carbon AI solutions (e.g., *DeepSeek*) for adaptive, energy-efficient learning.  
   - Promotes hybrid learning models (virtual + in-person) to reduce environmental impact.  

By integrating dynamic roles, self-sustainability, and low-carbon adaptability, this framework ensures scalability, resilience, and long-term impact in game-based learning.
